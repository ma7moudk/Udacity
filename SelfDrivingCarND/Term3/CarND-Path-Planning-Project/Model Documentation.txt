Model Description

These are the most important step we should do to generate a trajectory.

Check all lanes if they are empty in the next 30 m in front of the car and 6m behind the car and record the behind car speed if it exceeded Carla speed.

Decide to keep lane , decelerate , accelerate or change lane depending on lanes status and other cars speed.

Create a list of widely spaced (x,y) way points, evenly spaced at 30m , 60m , 90m in front of the car (in s) and in the middle of the lane (in d) besides current point and last one.

 Convert This Frenet space to XY space w.r.t. the car.

 Use spline to convert these 5 points to a feasible polynomial 

For a target point in front of the car (30m in front), output 50 trajectory points using this polynomial taking in consideration the last way-points and current cmd_vel.

Converting back the trajectory points to be absolute in road map instead of car-frame.

What can be done in the final project:
Adding prediction module will be a great add-up to the planner.
Adding a cost function for  lanes instead of if conditions.
